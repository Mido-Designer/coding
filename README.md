coding will be more interesting

hi , everyone ... some info about me ... i am abdelhamied i am interested in 3D Design..

 i was thinking how i can help here . i don't like coding so much .. (for me coding is very boring) .. so i got an idea to mix coding to something more interesting 

i was thinking for something different .. 

so i decided to mix coding with design (3D design specially) 

the idea i have is --> to make an add-on for blender that connected to the internet with a chat and sharing ideas and 3D models and maybe sell them something like skechfab or cgtrader 

** the reason why i choose blender cause it is open-source so i think it is more easier to deal with **
** the programming language will be python .. i am not sure if blender can accept more language or not **

another idea we might think about is --> to make something like 3D virtual environment to learn coding 
some  examples ::
* user will start in the some street and there is schools (school for python , c++ , etc)
* and give him a very simple way to learn coding .. even if we make him play some games
* etc

let's make coding more fun
so let's see what do u have
